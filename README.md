# Emotion Detection from Facial Images using Deep Learning

Implementation of convolutional neural network model similar to VGG-D that can detect emotions given facial images. Achieved an accuracy of 65% on the FER-2013 dataset using GPU for training and testing.

### Prerequisites
Python, TensorFlow, Keras (and other libraries such as NumPy, etc.). If using GPU for training, you will need an NVIDIA GPU card with software packages such as CUDA Toolkit 8.0 and cuDNN v5.1. See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux) for more details.
